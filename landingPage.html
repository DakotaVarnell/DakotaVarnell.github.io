        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Since I was a kid I've always wanted to build robots, but being from a small rural town I never knew that it was 
            an attainable goal.  I began my college career as a foreign language major focusing in Spanish and Mandarin but the moment I 
            heard UCA had a robotics team and a computer science department I immediately knew what I wanted to do in life.  I switched to
            computer science and never looked back. While I ultimately decided to focus on computer science, I still have a deep passion
            for robotics. I eventually became the treasurer of the computer science club and have made many friends
            along the way.  Aside from my academic interests I also enjoy playing guitar as well as going on long hikes.  I'm always looking to 
            strengthen my skills and gain knowledge through experience so if you have that kind of opportunity, contact me!
